I was inspired by http://blog.superpat.com/2010/06/01/zero-copy-in-linux-with-sendfile-and-splice/
which offers a link to a nice summary by Linus Torvalds from 2006 (https://web.archive.org/web/20130305002825/http://kerneltrap.org/node/6505)

Manpage: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html

> **splice()** moves data between two file descriptors without copying
> between kernel address space and user address space.  It transfers up
> to len bytes of data from the file descriptor fd_in to the file
> descriptor fd_out, where one of the file descriptors must refer to a
> pipe.

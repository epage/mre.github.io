In December 2015 I was looking for static analysis tools to integrate into trivago's CI process.
The idea was, to find common programming mistakes faster.
That's quite a common thing and there are a lot of helpful tools out there which fit the bill.

To my surprise, the only list I found was on Wikipedia &mdash; and it was a bit outdated.
There was no such project on Github, where most modern static analysis tools were hosted.

Without thinking too much about it, I started up my editor and wrote down the few tools I found through my initial research. After that, I pushed the list to Github. The project was to be called "awesome-static-analysis" (yes, I'm bursting with creativity).

Fast forward two years, and the list has grown quite a bit.
So far, it has seen 65 contributors, 261 forks and 1934 stars (thanks y'all!).

There is one problem though: The list of open pull requests gets longer and longer.
I have to admit that I feel a little guilty for not paying enough attention in the last few months.
Instead, I was busy building other things.

On the other side, the list is an important source of information for some people.
It is on the first page if you Google for "static analysis". Around 1000 unique visitors find the project ever week. That's not much at all, but those people deserve an up-to-date list.

### Adding contributors

The first thing I did was adding partners in crime. My colleague and friend [Andy Grunwald](https://github.com/andygrunwald) as well as [Ouroboros Chrysopoeia](https://github.com/impredicative) are both valuable collaborators. They help me weed out new PRs whenever they have time.

Checking pull requests is boring, manual work.

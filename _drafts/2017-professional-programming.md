# Being a Professional Programmer

When I was around 12, I set myself the goal to become a professional programmer.  
I can tell, because at this time I made the conscious decision to use my right hand to control the mouse &mdash; even though I'm left-handed.  
My reasoning was that if I ever had to help out a colleague with a computer problem I sure did not want to move over her mouse to the other side before getting started.  That would be awkward. 
(Of course I did not foresee the advent of the wireless mouse... As a matter of fact, I still use the right hand out of habit.)

One thing I always wanted to know is how a typical workday of a programmer looked like.
Was I wasting my time by pursuing this career?
Only later I found the answer &mdash; but I had to become a professional programmer first.
This article aims to save others from years of uncertainty.

Before you dig into this, be sure to read the first part of this series titled "Why I love Programming".

### What's the difference between "professional" and "hobby" programming?

In one word: *accountability*.  
You are expected to take ownership.

Programming in your freetime is like drinking alcohol without the headache: you can focus on the fun parts.
If you get bored you're free to move on.
In reality that's only 20 percent of the job.
Not so in professional programming, where you need to get the job done.
Depending on the project, the remaining 80 percent can be a drag to finish.

And even when a program reaches production, there is still lots of bugs fixing, refactoring and dare I say it, monkey patching to be done. Maintaining legacy code is no amusement park.

### Being a Junior Developer

Fresh out of school you might think you're already a pretty solid programmer. Let me tell you: you're not.
You wouldn't guess what talented people can do with computers. You
will learn so much in the first few years.

Professional software development is a very slow process at times. Writing readable, well-tested, well-documented code is a substantial effort. You will need patience; lots of it. Both with yourself and with others.

As a Junior Developer you only think in black and white. You look at some code
and it's all wrong. Who in their right mind created this horrible monstrosity?
As you become more experienced, you see the shades of grey.
This process is called "learning".

You finally understand that those neckbeards were not slower than you, they were
more careful. You learn how to test your code, how to document it. You even begin to
appreciate UML diagrams.


### Becoming obsolete

"The world is moving too fast. What you learned today is obsolete tomorrow. Why bother?".
I've heard that saying countless times throughout my career.
It's both, popular and wrong.

If your skills become obsolete so quickly, you learned the wrong skills.
Throughout your career you don't want to be known as "the Jenkins guy", you want to be the
expert in Software Quality. Hint: If you don't know what Jenkins is, that's the
whole point. You should not narrow your scope too much.
The right skills never become obsolete.

From time to time it happens, that due to some new company policy your beautiful project will be cancelled.
As depressing as it sounds: it's a normal part of the software business.
You need to adapt.
One advice I can give you is not to take it too seriously.
Drop the project but keep the learnings. Gather enough learnings to forge a
skill.


### Writing software in a non-perfect world

A professional programmer has to deal with deficiencies all the time. It's all about balancing constraints. Deadlines, budgets, code quality are just a few competing constraints we have to consider.
Elegant designs fade away in the face of reality.
In the end you want to earn money with your software, so you have to ship it!

The best developers I know, found the balance between pragmatism and elegance.

For me, I was always leaning more towards elegance.
That's just a nicer way to say I was a perfectionist.
I needed to learn the pragmatic part through hard work.

# Mentoring less experienced Programmers

> The better you become at programming, the less code you write.

Instead, you will spend more time thinking of Software Architecture, designing
big systems and splitting up the work into smaller junks for other developers to
work on.
You will start mentoring Junior Developers. Recruiting will require a lot of your
attention. Suddenly you will spend more time in Meetings, discussing project goals with
business people.
One might say, you take the role of a mediator. Others might call it management.

Once you know the in's and outs of the process you become an important asset for
the company. You might get asked to become a manager, or at least 
managing projects will slowly feel like a natural extension of your responsibilities.
Especially this slow and gradual process is dangerous.
Moving back to being a programmer is not easy. 
During the time you were busy with project management, others were improving their
coding skills.
You can try to keep up-to-date in your freetime but that's hard.

I've seen awesome developers become great managers. At some point in your career
it's a decision you need to make for yourself.

However you decide, it pays off to invest some time into learning how to
communicate. Empathy plays a big role in that.
Developing software as a team is so complex that a lot of time is spent on aligning on the goals and communicating problems. In fact, communication is what you get paid for. This counts in documentation, tests and the code itself.

Talk to others, listen to their problems. Read books about Software Project
Management, even though you don't want to be a manager yourself.

### A word about money

There's many good reasons to work in IT, but money is not one of them.

While it can be tempting to base your career decisions on prospective salary,
don't do it. You will be very unhappy. You will spend 8 hours or more each day thinking
about programs. That's a lot of time; and time is much more valuable than money.
I would happily trade 20% of my salary for one additional hour per day.

Don't get me wrong. There's plenty of jobs that pay good money. 
You will most likely not get filthy rich, though. If you want
to make it big, I can't help you. Maybe look into Real Estate or so...
The only way to get rich as a developer is to try something really risky and get
lucky. Startups, basically. Keep in mind: One Bill Gates takes a thousand failed
attempts.
Another way is to stop being a programmer and become a manager instead. 
I've already shared my opinion in the last section.

### Conclusion

While you should learn to read (and maybe write) code, working as a professional programmer is not for everyone.
You might ask: "Is it worth it? Shall I also become a professional developer?". 
For me it was the right decision. Hopefully I could help you to make your own.

Implementing Unix Tools in Rust

Why?
* A part of computing history
* Easy to understand
* Clear interface
* Separation of concerns
* Learn a thing or two about Rust

Not trying to reinvent the wheel. Just having fun.
Not aiming to be feature-complete or bug-free.

Let's get started:

yes
ls
for loop: repeat
ps
parallel

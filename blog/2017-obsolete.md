In December 2015 I was looking for static analysis tools to integrate into trivago's CI process.
The idea was, to detect typical programming mistakes automatically.
That's quite a common thing and there are a lot of helpful tools out there which fit the bill.

So I looked for a list of tools.  

To my surprise, the only list I found was on Wikipedia &mdash; and it was a bit outdated.
There was no such project on Github, where most modern static analysis tools are hosted.

Without thinking too much about it, I opened my editor and wrote down the few tools I found through my initial research. After that, I pushed the list to Github.  

Fast forward two years, and the list has grown quite a bit.
So far, it has 65 contributors, 261 forks and received 2000 stars (thanks y'all!).
Nothing special, but still a healthy project.  

The list has become an important source of information for many people.
Around 1000 unique visitors find the project every week. It's not much by any means, but those vistors deserve an up-to-date list.

There is one problem though: The list of pull requests gets longer and longer.
I have to admit that I feel a little guilty for not paying enough attention in the last few months.
I was busy building other things.

### Adding contributors

The first thing I did was adding partners in crime. My colleague and friend [Andy Grunwald](https://github.com/andygrunwald) as well as [Ouroboros Chrysopoeia](https://github.com/impredicative) are both valuable collaborators. They help me weed out new PRs whenever they have time.


### Bots bots bots

Checking pull requests is boring, manual work.

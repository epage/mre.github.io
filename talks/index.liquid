What makes a great public speaker? He's passionate, knowledgeable, and a good storyteller. I strive to become better at all of that.
Here are some of my recent presentations.<br />
If youâ€™d like me to speak at your event, <a href="mailto:&#109;&#097;&#116;&#116;&#104;&#105;&#097;&#115;&#045;&#101;&#110;&#100;&#108;&#101;&#114;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#120;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;">let's talk</a>.

"I'll just write a simple API wrapper for that. Give me two hours." Does that sound oddly familiar? Don't be fooled: writing an easy to use, idiomatic abstraction layer is a lot of work - in any language. I want to tell you my story about writing a Slack client in Rust. From documentation to testing and error handling there's a lot of pitfalls to avoid and laughs to share.

<h3>Why Rust?</h3>

</ul>
Rust is the new kid on the block. It's a system programming language that is blazingly fast and offers powerful high-level abstractions better known from dynamic languages like Ruby or Python. Rust offers memory safety without a Garbage Collector and makes low-level programming easier and more secure. I will give an introductory talk about Rust and show some of its nicest features.

<ul>
  <li class="talk_location">Python Usergroup D&uuml;sseldorf, April 2015</li>
  <li class="talk_video"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEzuUJGcPqc">Video</a></li>

</ul>
PyPy is a relatively new implementation of Python with a focus on performance. In this talk I give an overview of PyPy and how it works internally. Also I talk a bit about PyPy STM, a new approach for parallel code execution that can take advantage of modern multi-core hardware.
